<p>Lumenyárë Lambion Eldaliéva
Account of the History of Elvish Languages
from
the Parma Silmarienwa</p>

<p>Vardamir Ñólimon undertook deep study of the Eldarin languages, including investigation into the historical relationships among the various languages.
Tar-Elendil, who succeeded him, continued this study, extrapolating many previously unknown forms and deriving a comprehensive theory of the development of the language family over time. He also compiled Vardamir&rsquo;s lore into books, earning him the Quenya epithet Parmaitë. While this won him renown as a scholar, his actual approach was somewhat disingenuous. He tended to ignore data that didn&rsquo;t fit his theories, and when data were too sparse to confirm a theory, he simply invented certainties where none existed. This was because his study of the languages was not an end in itself, but an attempt to unite the linguistic histories of the Eldarin and Adûnaic families. Ultimately he hoped this would give the culture and national spirit of Númenor a more Elvish bent. Because of his Elvish sympathies, he was called Tar-Elendil.</p>

<p>In his youth, Tar-Elendil was always affectionate toward his younger sister Mairen, who was often overlooked by her parents in favor of elder brothers Elendil and Eärendur. It was perhaps in compensation for his parents&rsquo; favoritism that Tar-Elendil passed the heirlooms of Númenor, Narsil and the Ring of Barahir, to his daughter, Silmarien, rather than his son who was his heir. He also bestowed on her the books he had written and compiled from Vardamir&rsquo;s writings. Thus the volume containing the manuscript of this text, the only one of his books known to have survived the Downfall of Númenor, is called the Parma Silmarienwa.</p>

<p>The book containing Tar-Elendil&rsquo;s reconstruction of Quendian was, at the end of the Third Age, in Elrond&rsquo;s care in Rivendell. It was brought to Elrond as a gift by a visiting Ranger, but its history from the fall of Númenor until that point remains a mystery. Most likely it was housed until the fall of Arthedain in a library in Fornost that somehow escaped destruction by the Witch-King&rsquo;s forces.</p>

<h2>Structure of the Manuscript</h2>

<p>The book begins with an exposition of what is to follow, and then launches into a somewhat haphazard description of Quenya phonology. Since formal phonology was unknown in Númenor, Quenya sounds are described by reference to similar sounds in Adûnaic. The result is that this section is elaborate and occasionally baffling to modern readers. It is included mainly for its value to students of Adûnaic. We can learn a lot about Adûnaic accents by reading a Númenorean&rsquo;s description of Quenya sounds!</p>

<h1>Primitive Quendian</h1>

<p>The earliest Quendian words were formed from a <em>sundoma</em>, or base-vowel, and a sequence of consonant sounds. The <em>sundoma</em> could appear between the consonants, or before or after them</p>
