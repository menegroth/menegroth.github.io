<h1><em>Mae govannen!</em></h1>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve picked up this book, I assume I don&rsquo;t need to introduce you to J.R.R. Tolkien. Maybe you&rsquo;ve read <em>The Hobbit</em> or <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Maybe both. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve even delved into the <em>Silmarillion</em> or the <em>History of Middle-earth</em> series... or maybe you&rsquo;ve only read the first few chapters of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and put it down wondering what all the hype is about. That was my situation, years ago.</p>

<p>I first picked up The <em>Lord of the Rings</em> at the age of twelve or thirteen, and found it to be a merciless slog, devoid of the humor that made <em>The Hobbit</em> so delightful. But my friends were all raving about it—I couldn&rsquo;t just <em>not</em> read it. So I decided to cheat: I flipped through to the back of the book, to see how it ended.</p>

<p>What confronted me was not a climactic duel between Frodo and Sauron, but a hundred-odd pages worth of Appendices, filled with histories and genealogies and calendars, and above all <em>languages</em>. The Appendices gave me the sense that Tolkien&rsquo;s real goal with <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> was not to tell the story of Frodo or Sauron but <em>to create the world in which those stories could be told</em>. I began reading Tolkien with a new purpose: to discover Middle-earth. My reward was immeasurable.</p>

<p>What I discovered was what many others have discovered: Tolkien invented languages. Marvelous, intricate, beautiful languages. The Elvish greeting <em>Elen síla lúmenn&rsquo; omentielvo</em> isn&rsquo;t just pretty non&shy;sense—Tolkien worked out the grammar and history of the language (Quenya) in incredible detail. Despite appearing mostly in the Appendices, the languages were not an afterthought: they predated and in fact inspired the invention of Middle-earth. As Tolkien wrote in a letter to his publisher,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The invention of languages is the foundation. The <q>stories</q> were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in <q>Elvish</q>.<span class="cite">letters 221</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In light of such strong statements, it&rsquo;s clear that to understand Tolkien&rsquo;s work we need to share, or at least acknowledge, his passion for language.</p>

<p>However, Tolkien never shared this passion readily. He was always rather shy and self-deprecating about his language-creation habit, calling it a <q>secret vice</q> and a <q>mad hobby</q><span class="cite">letters 8</span>. He never sought to publish an Elvish grammar or dictionary—perhaps because he thought no one would be interested, but also because he loved the total creative freedom he had as a language inventor. Publishing information about Elvish would have forced him to get the languages into a <q>final</q> form and then stop working on them, and that was something he could never bring himself to do. For Tolkien, the fun of invented languages was in creating and re-creating, not in using a <q>finished</q> product.</p>

<p>Of course, we non-Tolkien people can&rsquo;t experience the joy of <em>creating</em> the Elvish languages. But we can <em>discover</em> them, and since our eyes are newly opened to Middle-earth, our experience will be fresher and keener than even the experience of a creator.</p>

<h2>Tolkien&rsquo;s Languages</h2>

<p>Tolkien imagined many different languages being spoken in Arda<span class="note">The name of Tolkien&rsquo;s fictional world, as a whole. <em>Middle-earth</em> is properly the name of only one continent in that world.</span>, but he really developed only two of them: the Elvish tongues <strong>Quenya</strong> and <strong>Sindarin</strong>. Quenya and Sindarin are sibling languages—they developed from a common ancestor, <strong>Eldarin</strong>, much as French and Spanish both developed from Latin. Tolkien worked out the evolution of each language in some detail, and this historical consistency is a huge help when trying to decipher the languages. Since Quenya and Sindarin are related we can use what we know about one to make educated guesses about the grammar and vocabulary of the other.</p>

<p>The Elvish languages are not designed to mirror any particular real-world languages, but Tolkien drew inspiration from the real languages he knew and loved. Quenya&rsquo;s abundant <em>L</em>s, rolled <em>R</em>s, and vowels echo Finnish and Latin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Ai! laurië lantar lassi súrinen,</em>
<em>Yéni únótimë ve rámar aldaron!</em>
<em>Yéni ve lintë yuldar avánier</em>
<em>mi oromardi lisse-miruvóreva [. . .]</em><span class="note"><em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, p. 394</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sindarin, by contrast, was inspired by Tolkien&rsquo;s first love, Welsh. Most words end in a consonant, and the hard consonants <strong>T</strong>, <strong>P</strong>, and <strong>K</strong> favored by Quenya were often <q>softened</q> to <strong>D</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>G</strong>. Sindarin also has the sound <strong>TH</strong>, which was replaced by <strong>S</strong> in Quenya.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>A Elbereth Gilthoniel,</em>
<em>silivren penna míriel</em>
<em>o menel aglar elenath!</em>
<em>Na-chaered palan-díriel</em>
<em>o galadhremmin ennorath,</em>
<em>Fanuilos, le linnathon,</em>
<em>nef aear, sí nef aearon!</em><span class="note"><em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, p. 250</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This book is about Sindarin—though I refer frequently to Quenya words and constructions that help shed light on Sindarin.</p>

<h2>Learning Tolkien&rsquo;s Languages</h2>

<p>Beginner-friendly guides to Elvish are often structured as language courses: they start out with some basic phrases and vocabulary, building up from there with examples of sentences and dialogue. By the end of the course, you have an understanding of the grammar and a feel for how to use the language in your own compositions.</p>

<p>The problem is, Tolkien never planned to make his languages usable—he was more interested in just making up words and imagining how they changed over time. His linguistic notes reflect this: they&rsquo;re full of beautiful words and historical details, but short on practical advice to language-learners.</p>

<p>This lack of practical source material means that we&rsquo;ll never be fluent in Sindarin—not as long as we stick to Tolkien canon. We can try to make Sindarin into a fully-usable language, but that requires creating new words and grammar that Tolkien never imagined and likely would not have approved of.</p>

<p>So if we want to <q>learn Tolkien's Elvish</q>, we&rsquo;re left with a dilemma. If we work only from Tolkien&rsquo;s examples, we don&rsquo;t have enough material to make a usable language. We&rsquo;ve <q>learned Tolkien</q> but we haven&rsquo;t <q>learned Elvish</q>. If we try to fill in the gaps, we end up with a non-canon language. We&rsquo;ve <q>learned Elvish</q> but disregarded Tolkien.</p>

<p>You might be wondering at this point which path you&rsquo;d rather take. The purpose of this book is to make it so that you don&rsquo;t have to decide once and for all. You can learn about Tolkien&rsquo;s writings, or about how we might <q>complete</q> Sindarin, as you like. I describe both possibilities. The book is divided into sections to make it clear where one type of investigation ends and the next begins.</p>

<p>The first section, <strong>Roots</strong>, describes the hard core of Tolkien&rsquo;s Sindarin—the parts of the language about which we&rsquo;re relatively certain, and which survived many, many cycles of Tolkien&rsquo;s ceaseless revision. Examples from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> provide most of the data, though I also refer to Tolkien&rsquo;s posthumously-published notes when they show that some feature of the language stayed constant throughout his life. Reading just this section will give you a solid understanding of the Sin&shy;darin in <em>LotR</em>. You&rsquo;ll be able to pronounce the words, write in <em>tengwar</em>, and put together Sindarin phrases of your own.</p>

<p>The second section, <strong>Branches</strong>, is about the tough decisions that Tolkien made (or avoided) when working out the grammar of Sindarin —there are many parts of the language where he just couldn&rsquo;t make up his mind. Often, we know that he considered multiple options for a particular piece of the grammar, but it&rsquo;s not clear which one he settled on or if he even did settle on anything. In such cases, I think it&rsquo;s best to describe the alternatives and their ramifications.</p>

<p>The final section, <strong>Scattered Leaves</strong>, covers the various attempts that have been made to <q>complete</q> Sindarin. You&rsquo;ll need to read this section to understand the Sindarin dialogue in the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> movies, since the language used there is largely a post-Tolkien invent&shy;ion.</p>

<h2>Online Resources</h2>

<p>This book is designed to complement the existing online resources for learning Sindarin, not to replace them. That&rsquo;s why I haven&rsquo;t included a dictionary or a list of Sindarin texts—you can easily find these on the web. That being said, the online resources vary widely in quality, so I&rsquo;ve posted a list of trusted links at <strong>menegroth.github.io/links.html</strong></p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>This book is a work in progress—the current version is in fact an alpha release, intentionally left incomplete in the interest of getting feedback quickly. If you read what I&rsquo;ve written so far and want more, please email me! Criticism is also very welcome, especially if you find actual mistakes (which I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve made), or you find a particular section hard to understand.</p>

<h1>A Short History of Sindarin</h1>

<h1>From Goldogrin to Sindarin</h1>

<h1>A Taste of Grey-Elven</h1>

<p>Sindarin has a system of consonant mutations that affect many parts of the grammar. The idea behind consonant mutations is that the first sound of a word will change in certain conditions, sometimes to express a particular grammatical idea, sometimes simply to harmonize better with the sound of the previous word. Consonant mutations play a large role in the fictional historical development of Sindarin and are one of the main ingredients that give it richness and depth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="s">Cîr tollen ammen</span> <q>Ships have come for us</q>
<span class="s">ach ú-aníron gîr</span> <q>but I do not desire ships</q>
<span class="s">i ven i chîr hollen anim</span> <q>the path of the ships is closed to me</q></p>
</blockquote>

<h1><a name="selected-vocabulary">Selected Vocabulary</a></h1>

<p>This is just a short selection of the most common Sindarin words. A comprehensive dictionary would take a book of its own, but fortunately for me I don&rsquo;t have to write one, since there are several good Sindarin wordlists available online. You can find links to them at the URL below:</p>

<p class="center">menegroth.github.io/links.html</p>

<h2>Pronunciation</h2>

<p>Pronounce the vowels as if they&rsquo;re Spanish or Italian. <span class="s">Y</span> is pronounced as in <em>icy</em> or like <em>ü</em> in German <em>über</em>. Most of these words happen to be stressed on the first syllable, though that&rsquo;s not the general rule in Sindarin. You can find a more complete pronunciation guide <a class="pageref" href="#pronunciation"></a>.</p>

<li><span class="s">gil</span> <q>star</q></li>
</ul>

<h2>Adjectives</h2>

<p>Sindarin adjectives usually come <em>after</em> the noun they modify—the opposite of English. Adjectives often have a distinct plural form, which must be used when the noun is plural: <span class="s">parth galen</span> <q>green field</q> vs. <span class="s">perth gelin</span> <q>green fields</q></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">aer</span> <q>holy</q></li>
<li><span class="s">agarwaen</span> <q>bloodstained</q></li>
<li><span class="s">alag</span> <q>rushing, impetuous</q></li>
<li><span class="s">alfirin</span> <q>immortal</q></li>
<li><span class="s">and</span> <q>long</q></li>
<li><span class="s">angren</span> <q>made of iron</q>, pl. <span class="s">engrin</span></li>
<li><span class="s">aglareb</span> <q>glorious</q>, pl. possibly <span class="s">eglerib</span></li>
<li><span class="s">annui</span> <q>western</q></li>
<li><span class="s">arnediad</span> <q>innumerable, countless, endless</q> (stressed on the second syllable: <span class="s">ar<span class="hi">ne</span>diad</span>)</li>
<li><span class="s">beleg</span> <q>great, mighty</q> (often mutated to <span class="s">veleg</span> after a noun)</li>
<li><span class="s">bronadui</span> <q>enduring, lasting</q></li>
<li><span class="s">calen</span> <q>green</q>, pl. <span class="s">celin</span> (often mutated to <span class="s">galen</span>, <span class="s">gelin</span> after a noun)</li>
<li><span class="s">fanui</span> <q>cloudy</q></li>
<li><span class="s">fíreb</span> <q>mortal</q>, pl. <span class="s">fírib</span></li>
<li><span class="s">iaur</span> <q>ancient, old, original</q></li>
</ul>

<h2>Verbs</h2>

<p>N.B.: All of these verbs are given in their <em>imperative</em> or <q>command</q> form—so they work for telling someone to do something, but not for describing what they did. For more verb forms, you&rsquo;ll have to read the upcoming chapters!</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">Noro!</span> <q>Run!</q></li>
<li><span class="s">Daro!</span> <q>Halt!</q></li>
<li><span class="s">Linno!</span> <q>Sing!</q></li>
<li><span class="s">Mado!</span> <q>Eat!</q></li>
<li><span class="s">Minno!</span> <q>Enter!</q></li>
<li><span class="s">Pedo!</span> <q>Speak!</q></li>
</ul>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">a</span> <q>and</q></li>
<li><span class="s">i</span> <q>the</q>, but only before singular nouns beginning in <span class="s">F</span>, <span class="s">L</span>, <span class="s">N</span>, <span class="s">TH</span>, <span class="s">W</span>, or a vowel. For other words, there&rsquo;s some extra grammar you need to know.</li>
<li><span class="s">in</span> <q>the</q>, used for plural nouns beginning in a vowel: <span class="s">in edhil</span> <q>the elves</q>, <span class="s">in eryd</span> <q>the mountains</q>.</li>
<li><span class="s">Ai!</span> <q>Alas!</q> or <q>Oh no!</q></li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="pronunciation">Pronunciation</a></h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to learn pronunciation from a book—an audio recording is worth a thousand words of print. This chapter will give you the basics, but you should also check out the online resources. These include recordings of Tolkien pronouncing Sindarin words from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>—naturally the ultimate source for learning to say them correctly yourself. You can find a list of links at menegroth.github.io/links.html.</p>

<p>Of course, the truly authoritative source for Sindarin pronunciation is Appendix E of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, upon which much of the material here is based.</p>

<h2>The Sounds of Sindarin</h2>

<p>Tolkien&rsquo;s languages have many imitators in fantasy literature, probably because they balance nicely between familiar and exotic. If you pronounce Sindarin like Latin or Greek you won&rsquo;t be far off. Still, Tolkien uses some sounds and spellings that differ enough from English to deserve mention, and these are discussed in detail below. The good news is that Sindarin&rsquo;s spelling is <em>phonetic</em>, so if you know how a word is pronounced, you can figure out how to spell it with 100% accuracy.</p>

<h3>Consonants</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">C</span> and <span class="s">G</span> are always hard, as in <em>cat</em> and <em>get</em>. <span class="s">Celeborn</span> is pronounced <q>Keleborn</q>.</li>
<li><span class="s">CH</span> is the sound in German <em>Bach</em>. If this sound gives you trouble, you could pronounce it <span class="s">H</span> or <span class="s">K</span>, as the Gondorians did. In the Gondor dialect the place-name <span class="s">Rochann</span> was pronounced <span class="s">Rohan</span>—hence the spelling used in <em>LotR</em>.</li>
<li><span class="s">R</span> is tapped or trilled, as in Spanish.</li>
<li><span class="s">TH</span> and <span class="s">DH</span> are the sounds of <em>thin</em> and <em>this</em>, respectively. The difference is that when you say <em>this</em> your vocal cords are vibrating—put a finger on your throat and you can feel the difference.</li>
<li><span class="s">LH</span> and <span class="s">RH</span> are like <span class="s">L</span> and <span class="s">R</span> pronounced <em>voicelessly</em>—that is, with no vocal cord vibration. These sounds are lifted straight from Welsh, where they&rsquo;re spelled <em>LL</em> and <em>RH</em>: <em>Llewellyn</em>, <em>Rhiannon</em>.</li>
<li><span class="s">HW</span> is similarly a voiceless version of <span class="s">W</span>. This is the WH-sound in <em>whale</em>, in varieties of English that pronounce it differently from <em>wail</em>.</li>
<li><span class="s">S</span> is <em>always</em> voiceless—it never has a Z-sound, even at the end of a word. The last syllable of <span class="s">Fanuilos</span> <q>Everwhite</q> sounds like <em>loss</em>.</li>
<li><span class="s">NG</span>, between vowels, is pronounced with a hard <span class="s">G</span> as in <em>finger</em>. elsewhere, it&rsquo;s pronounced as in <em>ring</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vowels</h3>

<p>The vowel letters A, E, I, O, and U correspond one-to-one with the vowel sounds <q>ah</q>, <q>eh</q>, <q>ee</q>, <q>oh</q>, <q>oo</q>. Tolkien was aiming for familiarity here: Spanish, Italian, and many other languages have similar vowel systems.</p>

<p>Even English, for all its crazy spelling, sometimes uses the five vowels with their Sindarin pronunciations:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">A</span>: &ldquo;f<span class="hi">a</span>ther&rdquo;</li>
<li><span class="s">E</span>: &ldquo;w<span class="hi">e</span>ll&rdquo;</li>
<li><span class="s">I</span>: &ldquo;mach<span class="hi">i</span>ne&rdquo;</li>
<li><span class="s">O</span>: &ldquo;f<span class="hi">o</span>r&rdquo;</li>
<li><span class="s">U</span>: &ldquo;br<span class="hi">u</span>te&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>With those examples in mind, try pronouncing these words:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">ungol</span> <q>spider</q></li>
<li><span class="s">lembas</span> <q>waybread</q></li>
<li><span class="s">Legolas</span> <q>Greenleaf</q></li>
<li><span class="s">Osgiliath</span> <q>Citadel of the Stars</q></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the five main vowels, Sindarin has a sixth vowel <span class="s">Y</span> with no equivalent in English. It&rsquo;s the sound of <em>u</em> in French <em>lune</em>, or <em>ü</em> in German <em>über</em>. To pronounce it, say <q>ee</q> but with your lips rounded as if saying <q>oo</q>.</p>

<p>If those instructions sound nonsensical, it&rsquo;s because <q>ee</q> usually stretches your lips into a smile, basically the opposite of <q>oo</q>. (That&rsquo;s why people say <q>cheese</q> for photos!) However, the other important feature of <q>ee</q> is that your mouth is nearly closed when saying it, leaving only a small air gap above your tongue. So combine that <q>closeness</q> with lip-rounding and you have the Sindarin <span class="s">Y</span> sound.</p>

<p>In Gondor, <span class="s">Y</span> was often pronounced the same as <span class="s">I</span>—the Gondorians found this sound as troublesome as we do.</p>

<h3>Accents and Vowel Length</h3>

<p>An acute accent (<span class="s">á é í ó ú ý</span>) indicates that the vowel is held for a slightly longer duration. So in a word like <span class="s">míriel</span> <q>sparkling like jewels</q>, the first syllable <span class="s">mí</span> is held about twice as long as the second syllable <span class="s">ri</span>.</p>

<p>A circumflex (<span class="s">â ê î ô û ŷ</span>) also indicates a long vowel, but is mostly used in words of one syllable. This may just be an aesthetic whim of Tolkien&rsquo;s, though he justified it by saying that vowels with the circumflex should be held <em>even longer</em>. However, the Elvish writing systems only distinguish two vowel lengths, long and short, so the Elves must not have considered this detail very important.</p>

<h3>Diphthongs</h3>

<p>A diphthong (pronounced <span class="pron">DIFF-thong</span>, from the Greek for <q>two sounds</q>) is a combination of two vowel sounds that blur together into a single syllable. Diphthongs appear frequently in English, like the <q>ou</q> in <q>house</q> that starts with an <q>ah</q> sound and ends with an <q>oo</q> sound. Sindarin has a similar diphthong, spelled <span class="s">au</span>.</p>

<p>Here is the complete list of Sindarin diphthongs:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">AI</span>: as in &ldquo;<span class="hi">ai</span>sle&rdquo;</li>
<li><span class="s">AE</span>: no English equivalent. <span class="s">AE</span> is a glide from an <span class="s">A</span> into an <span class="s">E</span>. The resulting sound should be similar to <span class="s">AI</span>; Tolkien even suggested pronouncing <span class="s">AE</span> the same as <span class="s">AI</span> if you&rsquo;re not picky. Or you could aim for a Mirkwood accent and pronounce it like <span class="s">E</span>: compare Mirkwood <span class="s">Legolas</span> to Classical Sindarin <span class="s">Laegolas</span>.</li>
<li><span class="s">AU</span>: like <em>ou</em> in &ldquo;h<span class="hi">ou</span>se&rdquo;.</li>
<li><span class="s">EI</span>: as in &ldquo;w<span class="hi">ei</span>gh&rdquo;</li>
<li><span class="s">OE</span>: like <em>oy</em> in &ldquo;b<span class="hi">oy</span>&rdquo;, but ending in an <q>eh</q> sound.</li>
<li><span class="s">UI</span>: as in <em>ruin</em>, but ending in an <q>ee</q> sound rather than the <q>ih</q> sound. Tolkien noted that this was a <q>long diphthong</q> and scanned as two syllables in poetry: hence <span class="s">Fanuilos, le linnathon</span> in the Hymn to Elbereth, where the meter requires eight syllables per line.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Special Cases</h2>

<h3>At the end of a word:</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">V</span>: The <span class="s">V</span>-sound is spelled <span class="s">F</span> at the end of a word: <span class="s">nef</span> <q>on this side of</q> is pronounced as <em>nev</em> in <em>never</em>. When the <span class="s">F</span>-sound occurs at the end of a word, it&rsquo;s spelled <span class="s">PH</span>, as in <span class="s">alph</span> <q>swan</q>. This quirk of spelling probably hearkens back to Tolkien&rsquo;s fondness for Welsh, where <em>F</em> has a V-sound.</li>
<li><span class="s">AU</span> is spelled <span class="s">AW</span> word-finally: <span class="s">caw</span> <q>top</q> sounds very similar to <em>cow</em>.</li>
<li><span class="s">W</span> can occur word-finally, which can be troublesome for English-speakers. To pronounce <span class="s">têw</span> <q>letter</q>, try saying <q>teh win</q> but stop at the <em>w</em>. In any case, <span class="s">têw</span> should never be pronounced as if it rhymes with <em>new</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>At the beginning of a word</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">IA</span>, <span class="s">IAU</span>, <span class="s">IE</span>, <span class="s">IO</span>, <span class="s">IUI</span>: When these combinations appear word-initially, the <span class="s">I</span> sounds like the <em>y</em> in <em>yes</em>. So <span class="s">ionnath</span> <q>sons</q> and <span class="s">Ioreth</span> <q>Old Woman</q> begin with a <em>yo</em> sound.</li>
<li><span class="s">ND</span>, <span class="s">MB</span>, <span class="s">NG</span>: These clusters can occur at the beginning of a word. Pronouncing these sounds is arguably the most challenging aspect of Sindarin pronunciation for English speakers, though it can certainly be mastered with practice. You may be happy to know that these word-initial clusters only arise due to mutations and therefore almost always follow a vowel, as in <span class="s">i mbair</span> <q>the lands</q>. This makes things somewhat easier; if you say <em>im bair</em> probably no one will notice.</li>
</ul>

<p>To complicate matters, the spelling <span class="s">NG</span> is actually ambiguous at the beginning of a word. Sometimes it represents a single, unitary sound, the <em>ng</em> in <em>ring</em>, while at other times it represents that sound plus <em>g</em>, as in <em>finger</em>. Each sound arises from a different type of mutation. At this point, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the distinction—pronouncing either of these sounds correctly is hard enough for a first lesson!</p>

<h2>Long Consonants</h2>

<p>In addition to having long and short vowels, Sindarin makes a contrast between long and short consonants. English also has this contrast in a few cases: <em>unaimed</em> has a short <em>n</em>, while <em>unnamed</em> (if you&rsquo;re trying to pronounce it differently from <em>unaimed</em>) has a long <em>n</em>.</p>

<p>In Sindarin spelling, a doubled letter means the consonant is long. For example, <span class="s">melon</span> <q>I love</q> has a short <span class="s">L</span>, while <span class="s">mellon</span> <q>friend</q> has a long <span class="s">L</span>.</p>

<p><span class="s">PH</span> is a tricky exception: at the beginning or end of a word it&rsquo;s a short <span class="s">F</span>-sound, pronounced as in <em>photograph</em>. However, in the middle of a word, it&rsquo;s long: <span class="s">ephel</span> <q>outer fence</q> is pronounced <em>ef-fel</em>.</p>

<p><span class="TODO">wtf is the deal with M vs MM? or S vs SS?</span></p>

<h2><a name="splitting-up-letter-combinations">Spelling Ambiguities</a></h2>

<p>The modern English alphabet simply doesn&rsquo;t have enough letters to represent Sindarin unambiguously. In compound words especially, confusion can arise.</p>

<p>The combinations <span class="s">DH</span>, <span class="s">LH</span>, <span class="s">RH</span>, <span class="s">TH</span> sometimes represent a sequence of two distinct sounds, e.g. <span class="s">T</span>+<span class="s">H</span>. For example, <span class="s">Panthael</span> (<q>Fullwise</q>, a name given to Sam Gamgee by Aragorn), is a compound <span class="s">pant+hael</span>, so the <span class="s">t</span> and <span class="s">h</span> are pronounced separately, as in <em>anthill</em>, not as in <em>anthem</em>. Similarly, <span class="s">Edhelharn</span> <q>Elfstone</q>, is a compound <span class="s">edhel+harn</span>.</p>

<p>So how do you know when to pronounce the letter-sequence <q>th</q> as <span class="s">T</span>+<span class="s">H</span>, and when to pronounce it as a single sound? The answer, unfortunately, is that you just have to memorize the (rare) cases where <q>th</q> represents <span class="s">T</span>+<span class="s">H</span>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the sounds <span class="s">LH</span> and <span class="s">RH</span> can&rsquo;t occur in the middle of a word, so if you see a word like <span class="s">Edhelharn</span> or <span class="s">Perhael</span> <q>Halfwise</q>, you know that the <span class="s">H</span> should be a separate sound.</p>

<p>The Elvish writing system <em>tengwar</em> doesn&rsquo;t have this ambiguity, because the sounds <span class="s">DH</span>, <span class="s">LH</span>, <span class="s">RH</span>, <span class="s">TH</span> each have their own symbol. So recognizing letter combinations that should be split up isn&rsquo;t just relevant for pronunciation—you need to know this to write in tengwar, as well!</p>

<h2>Stress</h2>

<p>Sindarin, like English, puts emphasis or <em>stress</em> on one syllable of multi-syllable words. In English, stress can alter the meaning of a word, as in the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sam received a <strong>present</strong> from Galadriel.
We have to <strong>present</strong> our project to the class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the first syllable stressed, &ldquo;<span class="hi">pre</span>sent&rdquo; is a noun. Stress the second syllable, &ldquo;pre<span class="hi">sent</span>&rdquo;, and it becomes a verb.</p>

<p>In Sindarin, the stress of a word can&rsquo;t change its meaning, but it&rsquo;s vital to learn how words are stressed in order to write poetry. If you pronounce words with the wrong stress, you&rsquo;ll just sound weird.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Sindarin stress is predicatable from the shape of the word, so you don&rsquo;t have to memorize where the stress falls for each word individually. This section describes how to figure out which syllable is stressed.</p>

<h3>Syllables</h3>

<p>Before you can place the stress in a word, you have to break it down into syllables. Many people find this difficult at first, but there&rsquo;s a trick to it: look at the vowels.</p>

<p>Each syllable has exactly one vowel or diphthong at its core—no more, no less. So <span class="s">Elbereth Gilthoniel</span> breaks down as <span class="s">El&middot;be&middot;reth Gil&middot;tho&middot;ni&middot;el</span>. <span class="s">Thranduil</span> has only two syllables, <span class="s">Thran&middot;duil</span>, because <span class="s">ui</span> is a diphthong.</p>

<h3>Stress in Two-Syllable Words</h3>

<p>Tolkien states in Appendix E that <q>[i]n words of two syllables, [the stress] falls in practically all cases on the first syllable</q>. Thus we have <span class="s"><span class="hi">Per</span>&middot;hael</span> <q>Samwise</q>, <span class="s"><span class="hi">El</span>&middot;rond</span>.</p>

<h3>Stress in Longer Words</h3>

<p>The general rule for longer words is to stress the third-to-last syllable: <span class="s"><span class="hi">El</span>&middot;be&middot;reth</span>, <span class="s">Gil&middot;<span class="hi">tho</span>&middot;ni&middot;el</span>, <span class="s"><span class="hi">Le</span>&middot;go&middot;las</span></p>

<p>However, the second-to-last syllable gets the stress if its vowel is:</p>

<ul>
<li>long (accented), as <span class="s">í</span> in <span class="s">Celeb<span class="hi">rí</span>an</span> (<q>Silver-queen</q>, Arwen&rsquo;s mother)</li>
<li>a diphthong, as <span class="s">ae</span> in <span class="s">Hi<span class="hi">thaeg</span>lir</span> (<q>the Misty Mountains</q>)</li>
<li>or followed by multiple consonants: <span class="s">Cele<span class="hi">brim</span>bor</span> (<q>Silver-fist</q>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in the last case it&rsquo;s consonant <em>sounds</em>, not letters, that are important. <span class="s">TH</span>, <span class="s">DH</span>, etc. are single sounds even though they&rsquo;re represented by two letters, so the <span class="s">th</span> in <span class="s"><span class="hi">Nim</span>brethil</span> doesn&rsquo;t cause the stress to move.</p>

<h3>Possible Exceptions to the Stress Rule</h3>

<p>There are some Sindarin names that don&rsquo;t seem to follow the stress rules in Appendix E, among them <span class="s">Imladris</span> (Rivendell) and <span class="s">Nargothrond</span>. These <q>should</q> be stressed <span class="s">Im<span class="hi">lad</span>ris</span>, <span class="s">Nar<span class="hi">goth</span>rond</span>, because the second-to-last syllable of each is followed by two consonants. However, we can observe that both are stressed on the first syllable in poetry. This issue is covered in depth <a class="pageref" href="#irregular-stress"></a>.</p>

<h1><a name="writing-systems">The Tengwar</a></h1>

<p>Tolkien&rsquo;s <em>tengwar</em> script is instantly recognizable—nothing evokes <q>elvish</q> like a snippet of <em>tengwar</em> text. It&rsquo;s easy to understand why the <em>tengwar</em> are popular—you don&rsquo;t have to be a Tolkien buff or a language geek to be struck by their beauty.</p>

<p class="center text">
<span class="tai">&#187;</span><span class="ti">AE5,Ex26Yw1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; AE5,ExxwP%1Ej^</span><span class="tai">&#171;</span>
</p>

<p class="center text">
<span class="ti">AE5,Ex37zE1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; X#w6Ykt^AT`Bz7qpT1Ej^</span>
</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the One Ring inscription, probably the most famous example of the Elvish script. But if you get it tattooed around your arm and claim that it&rsquo;s in an Elvish <em>language</em>, the joke&rsquo;s on you—it&rsquo;s actually Sauron&rsquo;s Black Speech, written with <em>tengwar</em> letters. Transcribed into our Roman alphabet, the Ring inscription goes:</p>

<p class="center text">
<em>
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,<br/>
ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
</em>
</p>

<p>Not sounds that any Elf would want to utter!</p>

<p>This serves to highlight an important point: the <em>tengwar</em> aren&rsquo;t a language; they&rsquo;re a writing system that, much like our own alphabet, can be applied to many different languages.</p>

<p>This chapter focuses on writing Sindarin, though there&rsquo;s also a section on how to write English with <em>tengwar</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>tengwar</em> were invented by Fëanor in Aman, and so were first used to write Quenya. But Fëanor, always ambitious, didn&rsquo;t just devise an alphabet solely for his own language. He created a system so versatile that it could be adapted to <em>any</em> language. Thus when the exiled Noldor brought the <em>tengwar</em> to Middle-earth, they were able to use the script to write Sindarin. By the Third Age there were multiple styles or <q>modes</q> for writing Sindarin with <em>tengwar</em>, each with its own spelling conventions.</p>

<h2>The Mode of Beleriand</h2>

<p>The <em>Mode of Beleriand</em> is the most ancient of the Sindarin tengwar styles. The letters correspond one-to-one with Sindarin sounds, as shown below:</p>

<p><sup>&#42;</sup>It&rsquo;s uncertain what letter was used for <span class="s">NG</span>. David Salo suggests <span class="t">g</span> in <em>A Gateway to Sindarin</em>, as does Måns Björkman on his website <em>Amanye Tenceli</em>. It&rsquo;s a reasonable guess since <span class="t">g</span> is used for <em>NG</em> in Quenya, and fits in with the general pattern of how the <em>tengwar</em> are assigned to sounds in Sindarin.</p>

<div class="TODO">

<p>Similarly uncertain is the <em>tengwa</em> for <span class="s">HW</span>. Appendix E notes that <q>[<span class="t">o</span>] was mostly used (if at all) for voiceless <em>w</em></q>. Additionally, the Quenya name of the letter <span class="t">o</span>, <em>hwesta sindarinwa</em>, strongly suggests that it was used for writing Sindarin. However, Tolkien&rsquo;s writings contain no examples of this letter in actual use, and it&rsquo;s unclear why the Noldor would have felt the need to create a special letter for Sindarin <span class="s">HW</span> when the same sound existed in Quenya and was written <span class="t">c</span>.</p>

</div>

<h3>Vowels and Diphthongs</h3>

<p>Long vowels were given an accent mark: <span class="t">&#93;F</span> represented <span class="s">á</span> or <span class="s">â</span>. The Sindarin term for this is <span class="s">andaith</span> <q>long-mark</q>.</p>

<p>For diphthongs, the scribes used a <em>tengwa</em> to represent the first vowel. A mark (<em>tehta</em> in Quenya) above the <em>tengwa</em> was often used for the second vowel. However, Tolkien notes in Appendix E that <q>the diphthongs were often written out in full</q>, as <span class="t">&#93;l</span> in the <em>tengwar</em> transcription of <em>A Elbereth Gilthoniel</em>.</p>

<h3>Abbreviations</h3>

<p>The early Sindarin scribes liked to abbreviate common letter com&shy;bi&shy;na&shy;tions. Double <span class="s">NN</span> and <span class="s">MM</span> were represented by doubling the curved <q>bow</q> of <span class="t">6</span> and <span class="t">y</span>, producing <span class="t">5</span> and <span class="t">t</span>. An <span class="s">N</span> or <span class="s">M</span> before another consonant was abbreviated as a bar or wavy line above the consonant: <span class="t">1p</span> for <span class="s">NT</span>, <span class="t">wP</span> for <span class="s">MB</span>, etc.</p>

<h3>The Complicated Matter of <em>W</em></h3>

<p>A mark like a flattened S (also used for the diphthong <span class="s">AU</span>) might have been used for a following <span class="s">W</span> sound: <span class="s">Narwain</span> <q>January</q> might have been written <span class="t">6&#93;7ê&#93;Ö6</span>. In Appendix E, Tolkien mentions that this symbol was <q>required for the expression of <em>au</em>, <em>aw</em>,</q> perhaps meaning that it was used only in that circumstance, and <span class="t">n</span> was used elsewhere for <span class="s">W</span>.
For <span class="s">GW</span>, there is an additional layer of complication. The Noldor, on first encountering Sindarin, would likely have used <span class="t">x</span> for <span class="s">GW</span>, since that spelling closely mirrors Quenya. <span class="s">Gwirith</span> <q>April</q> might be written <span class="t">x&#96;7&#96;3</span>. This ties in nicely with the use of <span class="t">c</span> for <span class="s">CHW</span>, which Tolkien implies (but does not quite state) in Appendix E: <q><em>hwesta sindarinwa</em> [<span class="t">o</span>] or <q>Grey-elven <em>hw</em></q> was so called because in Quenya [<span class="t">c</span>] had the sound of <em>hw</em>, and distinct signs for <em>chw</em> and <em>hw</em> were not required.</q></p>

<p>Thus, the possibilities for writing <span class="s">GW</span> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="t">x&#96;7&#96;3</span> &middot; <span class="s">Gwirith</span></li>
<li><span class="t">sè&#96;7&#96;3</span> &middot; <span class="s">Gwirith</span></li>
<li><span class="t">sn&#96;7&#96;3</span> &middot; <span class="s">Gwirith</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Which of these was used is not certain.</p>

<p>For other consonant clusters ending in <span class="s">W</span>, there are only two possibilities: the <span class="t">&nbsp;ê</span>-<em>tehta</em> or the <em>tengwa</em> <span class="t">n</span>.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="t">6&#93;7ê&#93;Ö6</span> &middot; <span class="s">Narwain</span></li>
<li><span class="t">6&#93;7n&#93;Ö6</span> &middot; <span class="s">Narwain</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>Ambiguities</h3>

<p>When writing in tengwar, keep in mind that the Elves didn&rsquo;t use our Roman alphabet, so they would have spelled Sindarin words according to their sound and not the letters we use to represent them. <span class="s">Nef</span> ends with a <q>v</q> sound and so should be spelled <span class="t">6lr</span> in tengwar. Similarly, <span class="t">m</span> is only used for <span class="s">LH</span> when the single sound <span class="s">LH</span> is meant. <span class="s">Edhelharn</span>, being a compound <span class="s">Edhel</span> + <span class="s">harn</span>, would be spelt <span class="t">l4lj9&#93;76</span>. The issue of spelling ambiguities is covered <a class="pageref" href="#splitting-up-letter-combinations"></a>.</p>

<p>If you want to try your hand at translating the Sindarin as well, here&rsquo;s a clue: all the words can be found in the vocabulary list that starts <a class="pageref" href="#selected-vocabulary"></a>.</p>

<h2>The Organization of the <em>Tengwar</em></h2>

<p>The table of consonants for the Mode of Beleriand is pretty dyslexia-inducing: the letters all look sort of similar but there&rsquo;s no obvious pattern in the way they&rsquo;re assigned to sounds.</p>

<p>In fact, there <em>is</em> a pattern—it&rsquo;s just not apparent when the <em>tengwar</em> are arranged according to our alphabet. Here are the main <em>tengwar</em> as the Elves arranged them:</p>

<table class="col-3 columns">

<li><span class="tab">O</span><span class="t letterform">h</span></li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the top row are the hard, <em>unvoiced</em> consonants, which all have a downward <q>stem</q> (Quenya <em>telco</em>) and single <q>bow</q> (<em>lúva</em>). In the second row, we have the voiced counterparts of these—the voicing being reflected in the <em>tengwar</em> by doubling the <em>lúva</em>.</p>

<p>The third and fourth rows are almost a duplicate of the first two—the difference is that the <em>telqui</em> (pl. of <em>telco</em>) are extended up instead of down. The associated sounds are <em>spirants</em>, which draw out the sound into a hiss or buzz.</p>

<p>The fifth and sixth rows are a little more chaotic; <span class="t">h</span> for <span class="s">O</span> is the odd letter out as all the others represent <em>nasals</em> (sounds that redirect air through the nose).</p>

<p>If we look at the <em>columns</em> of the table, a complementary pattern emerges. The first column has all the <em>dental</em> consonants, which place the tip of the tongue on (or just behind) the upper teeth. The second column is all <em>labial</em> consonants, which involve the lips. And the third column (with the exception of the outlier <span class="t">h</span>) is all <em>velar</em> consonants, in which the tongue rises to the roof of the mouth.</p>

<p>Note that the letter <span class="t">f</span> fills out the pattern but doesn&rsquo;t have an associated Sindarin sound. If we follow the pattern of the other <em>tengwar</em>, the sound of <span class="t">f</span> would be a voiced version of <span class="s">CH</span>. This gutteral sound doesn&rsquo;t occur in Sindarin but is present in the Black Speech, for example in <em>agh</em> <q>and</q>.</p>

<p>What about the other <em>tengwar</em>, like <span class="t">j</span>, <span class="t">7</span>, and <span class="t">8</span>? Their sounds don&rsquo;t fit into the grid system so nicely, and their irregular shapes (deviating from the <em>telco</em>-<em>lúva</em> pattern) reflect this.</p>

<h2>The <em>Ómatehta</em> Mode</h2>

<p><em>Ómatehtar</em> (Quenya for <q>vowel-signs</q>) are the dots and curls above the letters in the Ring inscription. In LotR Appendix E they&rsquo;re referred to simply as <em>tehtar</em>, or <q>marks</q>. They represent the vowels in many <em>tengwar</em> modes.</p>

<p><em>Ómatehtar</em> were not used until late in Sindarin&rsquo;s history. The Sindarin <em>ómatehta</em> mode is associated mainly with the Men of Gondor, and is sometimes called the Mode of Gondor.</p>

<p>The consonant letters follow mostly the same patterns in the Mode of Beleriand, but except for <span class="s">C</span>,  <span class="s">CH</span>, <span class="s">G</span>. In Gondor, the letters <span class="t">a</span>, <span class="t">s</span>, and <span class="t">d</span>  were used for writing the sounds <em>ch</em> (as in <em>church</em>), <em>j</em>, and <em>sh</em>, which were common in the Westron language. Gondorians thus preferred to use <span class="t">z</span>, <span class="t">c</span>, and <span class="t">x</span> for Sindarin <span class="s">C</span>, <span class="s">CH</span>, and <span class="s">G</span>.</p>

<p>What if there&rsquo;s no consonant immediately following the vowel? In that case, the vowel <em>tehta</em> is placed on a carrier <em>tengwa</em> <span class="t">&#96;</span>. The carrier has no sound of its own; it just gives the <em>tehta</em> a place to sit.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="t">q2$&#96;N</span> &middot; <span class="s">pedo</span> <q>speak</q></li>
<li><span class="t">xj%35^&#96;Bj$</span> &middot; <span class="s">Gilthoniel</span></li>
</ul>

<p>For long vowels, the <em>andaith</em> of course can&rsquo;t be used. Instead, the vowel <em>tehta</em> is placed on a long carrier letter <span class="t">~</span>. This type of carrier is used even if there&rsquo;s a following consonant.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="t">t~B7&#96;Bj$</span> &middot; <span class="s">míriel</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>R, S, and Y</h3>

<p>The <em>ómatehta</em> mode uses two different letters for <span class="s">R</span>: <span class="t">7</span> and <span class="t">6</span>. <span class="t">6</span> is used at the end of words, while <span class="t">7</span> is used elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Abbreviations</h3>

<p>The <em>ómatehta</em> mode uses the same abbreviations as the Mode of Beleriand, plus a few more. A bar below a <em>tengwa</em> indicates that the letter is doubled. However, double <span class="s">NN</span> and <span class="s">MM</span> use the wavy line above instead—just like in the Mode of Beleriand, this indicates a preceding nasal sound.</p>

<h2>Writing Tengwar with Mundane Implements</h2>

<h1><a name="imperatives">Wishes, Commands</a></h1>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got the basics of how to pronounce and write Sindarin words, it&rsquo;s time to start putting together longer phrases and sentences. To do this, you need to know Sindarin&rsquo;s grammar.</p>

<p>Commands and wishes are among the most common types of Sindarin phrases in Tolkien&rsquo;s writings. For instance, we have:</p>

<div class="indented">

<ul>
<li>Glorfindel&rsquo;s cry to his horse Asfaloth: <span class="s">Noro lim, noro lim Asfaloth!</span> No translation is given, but <span class="s">noro lim</span> probably means <q>Run fast!</q></li>
<li>Haldir&rsquo;s command to the Fellowship in Lórien: <span class="s">Daro!</span> <q>Halt!</q></li>
<li>Sam&rsquo;s invocation of Elbereth, which ends <span class="s">A tiro nín, Fanuilos!</span> <q>O look towards me, Everwhite!</q></li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>The common element in all of these examples is a verb ending in <span class="s">-o</span>: <span class="s">noro</span>, <span class="s">daro</span>, <span class="s">tiro</span>. This form of the verb is called the <em>imperative</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to create the imperative form of a verb from its dictionary form: just add <span class="s">o</span> to the end. If the dictionary form of the verb ends in an <span class="s">a</span>, drop the <span class="s">a</span> before adding <span class="s">o</span>.</p>

<div class="indented">

<ul>
<li><span class="s">linna-</span> <q>sing</q> &rarr; <span class="s">linno</span></li>
<li><span class="s">car-</span> <q>do</q> or <q>make</q> &rarr; <span class="s">caro</span></li>
<li><span class="s">beria-</span> <q>protect</q> &rarr; <span class="s">berio</span></li>
<li><span class="s">cen-</span> <q>see</q> &rarr; <span class="s">ceno</span></li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>Note that most Sindarin dictionaries list words by their <em>stem form</em>. The stem form often can&rsquo;t stand as a word on its own; you have to add endings to use it in a sentence. To indicate that an ending needs to be added, dictionaries typically add a dash. For example, the online dictionary <em>Hiswelokë</em> lists <span class="s">nor-</span> as the stem of the verb <q>to run</q>.</p>

<h2>Direct Objects</h2>

<p>Some verbs don&rsquo;t make a whole lot of sense without a target for the action—in grammar terms, a <em>direct object</em>. For example, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t say <span class="s">berio!</span> <q>protect!</q> in Sindarin without specifying <em>what</em> to protect.</p>

<p>In Sindarin, as in English, the direct object usually<span class="TODO">how often?</span> follows the verb.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">Berio i pheriain!</span> <q>Protect the hobbits!</q></li>
<li><span class="s">Anglenno i aran.</span> <q>Approach the king.</q></li>
<li><span class="s">Leithio i philin!</span> <q>Release the arrows!</q></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="TODO">it&rsquo;s not clear whether transitive verbs exist as a distinct category in Sindarin, or, if they do, whether they can be used intransitively in the sense of e.g. <q>protect (things in general)</q>. The most conservative assumption is perhaps that transitive verbs do exist and cannot be used intransitively (unless examples of normally transitive verbs used intransitively exist). However, it should probably be made clear that this is a pretty big and limiting assumption.</span></p>

<h1><a name="possessives">Possessives</a></h1>

<p>Possessive pronouns—<em>my</em>, <em>your</em>, <em>their</em>—tell you who owns something. In English, these precede the noun they&rsquo;re modifying, but in Sindarin they follow it: <em><span class="hi">my</span> book</em> vs. <span class="s">parf <span class="hi">nín</span></span>.</p>

<h2>Vowel Mutation Plurals</h2>

<p>In English, we usually form the plural of a noun by adding <em>-s</em>: one <em>wug</em>, two <em>wugs</em>. A few nouns use some kind of vowel mutation instead: one <em>man</em>, two <em>men</em>, one <em>goose</em>, two <em>geese</em>.</p>

<p>In Sindarin, this kind of vowel mutation is the normal way of forming plurals. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s quite regular and predictable once you learn the rules.</p>

<p>Each vowel changes in a different way depending on whether it&rsquo;s in the final syllable of a word or not. The changes are shown in the table below. Note that there&rsquo;s no row for <span class="s">I</span> as it never mutates.</p>

<table class="columns">

  <td><span class="s">Y</span></td>
  <td><span class="s">curu</span> "skill" &rarr; <span class="s">cyry</span> "skills"</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The long vowels <span class="s">Ê</span> and <span class="s">Ô</span> remained long when mutated: <span class="s">têw</span> <q>sign</q> becomes <span class="s">tîw</span> in the plural.</p>

<p>How <span class="s">Û</span> behaved is uncertain, since we have only a single example: <span class="s">Emyn Duir</span> <q>dark mountains</q> as the plural of <span class="s">Amon Dûr</span><span class="note"><em>Unfinished Tales</em> p. 280</span>—the adjective <span class="s">dûr</span> <q>dark</q> is affected by the same plural mutation as the noun it modifies. We might tentatively conclude from this that <span class="s">Û</span> always becomes <span class="s">UI</span> in the plural.</p>

<h3>Irregular Vowel Mutations</h3>

<h2>The Class Plural</h2>

<p>In addition to the simple plural to denote more than one of something, Sindarin nouns also have a <em>class plural</em> form denoting <em>all</em> of that thing (or at least a very large number). In general, the class plural is formed with a suffix <span class="s">-ath</span>: <span class="s">Periannath</span> <q>Hobbits</q> from <span class="s">perian</span>; <span class="s">Sammath</span> <q>chambers</q> from <span class="s">sam</span>.</p>

<p>From the examples given above you&rsquo;ll note that the <span class="s">-ath</span> suffix can change the final consonant of a word.</p>
