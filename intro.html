<h1><em>Mae govannen!</em></h1>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve picked up this book, I assume I don&rsquo;t need to introduce you to J.R.R. Tolkien. Maybe you&rsquo;ve read <em>The Hobbit</em> or <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Maybe both. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve even delved into the <em>Silmarillion</em> or the <em>History of Middle-earth</em> series... or maybe you&rsquo;ve only read the first few chapters of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and put it down wondering what all the hype is about. That was my situation, years ago.</p>

<p>I first picked up The <em>Lord of the Rings</em> at the age of twelve or thirteen, and found it to be a merciless slog, devoid of the humor that made <em>The Hobbit</em> so delightful. But my friends were all raving about it—I couldn&rsquo;t just <em>not</em> read it. So I decided to cheat: I flipped through to the back of the book, to see how it ended.</p>

<p>What confronted me was not a climactic duel between Frodo and Sauron, but a hundred-odd pages worth of Appendices, filled with histories and genealogies and calendars, and above all <em>languages</em>. The Appendices gave me the sense that Tolkien&rsquo;s real goal with <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> was not to tell the story of Frodo or Sauron but <em>to create the world in which those stories could be told</em>. I began reading Tolkien with a new purpose: to discover Middle-earth. My reward was immeasurable.</p>

<p>What I discovered was what many others have discovered: Tolkien invented languages. Marvelous, intricate, beautiful languages. The Elvish greeting <em>Elen síla lúmenn&rsquo; omentielvo</em> isn&rsquo;t just pretty non&shy;sense—Tolkien worked out the grammar and history of the language (Quenya) in incredible detail. Despite appearing mostly in the Appendices, the languages were not an afterthought: they predated and in fact inspired the invention of Middle-earth. As Tolkien wrote in a letter to his publisher,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The invention of languages is the foundation. The <q>stories</q> were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in <q>Elvish</q>.<span class="cite">letters 221</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In light of such strong statements, it&rsquo;s clear that to understand Tolkien&rsquo;s work we need to share, or at least acknowledge, his passion for language.</p>

<p>However, Tolkien never shared this passion readily. He was always rather shy and self-deprecating about his language-creation habit, calling it a <q>secret vice</q> and a <q>mad hobby</q><span class="cite">letters 8</span>. He never sought to publish an Elvish grammar or dictionary—perhaps because he thought no one would be interested, but also because he loved the total creative freedom he had as a language inventor. Publishing information about Elvish would have forced him to get the languages into a <q>final</q> form and then stop working on them, and that was something he could never bring himself to do. For Tolkien, the fun of invented languages was in creating and re-creating, not in using a <q>finished</q> product.</p>

<p>Of course, we non-Tolkien people can&rsquo;t experience the joy of <em>creating</em> the Elvish languages. But we can <em>discover</em> them, and since our eyes are newly opened to Middle-earth, our experience will be fresher and keener than even the experience of a creator.</p>

<h2>Tolkien&rsquo;s Languages</h2>

<p>Tolkien imagined many different languages being spoken in Arda<span class="note">The name of Tolkien&rsquo;s fictional world, as a whole. <em>Middle-earth</em> is properly the name of only one continent in that world.</span>, but he really developed only two of them: the Elvish tongues <strong>Quenya</strong> and <strong>Sindarin</strong>. Quenya and Sindarin are sibling languages—they developed from a common ancestor, <strong>Eldarin</strong>, much as French and Spanish both developed from Latin. Tolkien worked out the evolution of each language in some detail, and this historical consistency is a huge help when trying to decipher the languages. Since Quenya and Sindarin are related we can use what we know about one to make educated guesses about the grammar and vocabulary of the other.</p>

<p>The Elvish languages are not designed to mirror any particular real-world languages, but Tolkien drew inspiration from the real languages he knew and loved. Quenya&rsquo;s abundant <em>L</em>s, rolled <em>R</em>s, and vowels echo Finnish and Latin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Ai! laurië lantar lassi súrinen,</em>
<em>Yéni únótimë ve rámar aldaron!</em>
<em>Yéni ve lintë yuldar avánier</em>
<em>mi oromardi lisse-miruvóreva [. . .]</em><span class="note"><em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, p. 394</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sindarin, by contrast, was inspired by Tolkien&rsquo;s first love, Welsh. Most words end in a consonant, and the hard consonants <strong>T</strong>, <strong>P</strong>, and <strong>K</strong> favored by Quenya were often <q>softened</q> to <strong>D</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>G</strong>. Sindarin also has the sound <strong>TH</strong>, which was replaced by <strong>S</strong> in Quenya.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>A Elbereth Gilthoniel,</em>
<em>silivren penna míriel</em>
<em>o menel aglar elenath!</em>
<em>Na-chaered palan-díriel</em>
<em>o galadhremmin ennorath,</em>
<em>Fanuilos, le linnathon,</em>
<em>nef aear, sí nef aearon!</em><span class="note"><em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, p. 250</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This book is about Sindarin—though I refer frequently to Quenya words and constructions that help shed light on Sindarin.</p>

<h2>Learning Tolkien&rsquo;s Languages</h2>

<p>Beginner-friendly guides to Elvish are often structured as language courses: they start out with some basic phrases and vocabulary, building up from there with examples of sentences and dialogue. By the end of the course, you have an understanding of the grammar and a feel for how to use the language in your own compositions.</p>

<p>The problem is, Tolkien never planned to make his languages usable—he was more interested in just making up words and imagining how they changed over time. His linguistic notes reflect this: they&rsquo;re full of beautiful words and historical details, but short on practical advice to language-learners.</p>

<p>This lack of practical source material means that we&rsquo;ll never be fluent in Sindarin—not as long as we stick to Tolkien canon. We can try to make Sindarin into a fully-usable language, but that requires creating new words and grammar that Tolkien never imagined and likely would not have approved of.</p>

<p>So if we want to <q>learn Tolkien's Elvish</q>, we&rsquo;re left with a dilemma. If we work only from Tolkien&rsquo;s examples, we don&rsquo;t have enough material to make a usable language. We&rsquo;ve <q>learned Tolkien</q> but we haven&rsquo;t <q>learned Elvish</q>. If we try to fill in the gaps, we end up with a non-canon language. We&rsquo;ve <q>learned Elvish</q> but disregarded Tolkien.</p>

<p>You might be wondering at this point which path you&rsquo;d rather take. The purpose of this book is to make it so that you don&rsquo;t have to decide once and for all. You can learn about Tolkien&rsquo;s writings, or about how we might <q>complete</q> Sindarin, as you like. I describe both possibilities. The book is divided into sections to make it clear where one type of investigation ends and the next begins.</p>

<p>The first section, <strong>Roots</strong>, describes the hard core of Tolkien&rsquo;s Sindarin—the parts of the language about which we&rsquo;re relatively certain, and which survived many, many cycles of Tolkien&rsquo;s ceaseless revision. Examples from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> provide most of the data, though I also refer to Tolkien&rsquo;s posthumously-published notes when they show that some feature of the language stayed constant throughout his life. Reading just this section will give you a solid understanding of the Sin&shy;darin in <em>LotR</em>. You&rsquo;ll be able to pronounce the words, write in <em>tengwar</em>, and put together Sindarin phrases of your own.</p>

<p>The second section, <strong>Branches</strong>, is about the tough decisions that Tolkien made (or avoided) when working out the grammar of Sindarin —there are many parts of the language where he just couldn&rsquo;t make up his mind. Often, we know that he considered multiple options for a particular piece of the grammar, but it&rsquo;s not clear which one he settled on or if he even did settle on anything. In such cases, I think it&rsquo;s best to describe the alternatives and their ramifications.</p>

<p>The final section, <strong>Scattered Leaves</strong>, covers the various attempts that have been made to <q>complete</q> Sindarin. You&rsquo;ll need to read this section to understand the Sindarin dialogue in the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> movies, since the language used there is largely a post-Tolkien invent&shy;ion.</p>

<h2>Online Resources</h2>

<p>This book is designed to complement the existing online resources for learning Sindarin, not to replace them. That&rsquo;s why I haven&rsquo;t included a dictionary or a list of Sindarin texts—you can easily find these on the web. That being said, the online resources vary widely in quality, so I&rsquo;ve posted a list of trusted links at <strong>menegroth.github.io/links.html</strong></p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>This book is a work in progress—the current version is in fact an alpha release, intentionally left incomplete in the interest of getting feedback quickly. If you read what I&rsquo;ve written so far and want more, please email me! Criticism is also very welcome, especially if you find actual mistakes (which I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve made), or you find a particular section hard to understand.</p>
