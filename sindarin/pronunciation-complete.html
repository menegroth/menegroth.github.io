<h1>Sindarin Pronunciation</h1>

<p>This page is intended to be a <em>complete</em> guide to the sounds of Sindarin. Because of that, it&#39;s <em>super long</em>, and some of what&#39;s here may not seem relevant until you&#39;ve explored the language further. If you get bogged down in the details, there&#39;s also a <a href="./pronunciation-quick.html">quick guide</a> that just covers the basics.</p>

<h2>Vowels</h2>

<p>English-speakers tend to think of there being <em>five vowels</em>: A, E, I, O, and U. However, these are just the vowel <em>letters</em>. English has way more than five vowel <em>sounds</em>. Just look at this list:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pete         poot
pit          put
pate         pout
pet          putt
pat          pot
pike         poke</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sindarin doesn&#39;t have English&#39;s huge variety of sounds. In Sindarin, the five main vowels <span class="s">A</span>, <span class="s">E</span>, <span class="s">I</span>, <span class="s">O</span>, and <span class="s">U</span> are always pronounced the same way.</p>

<h3>The Big Five</h3>

<p>Pronounce Sindarin <span class="s">A</span>, <span class="s">E</span>, <span class="s">I</span>, <span class="s">O</span>, <span class="s">U</span> as <q>ah</q>, <q>eh</q>, <q>ee</q>, <q>oh</q>, <q>oo</q>. Tolkien was aiming for familiarity here: Spanish, Italian, and many other languages have similar vowel systems.</p>

<p>Even English sometimes uses the five vowels with their Sindarin pronunciations:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">A</span>: &ldquo;f<span class="hi">a</span>ther&rdquo;</li>
<li><span class="s">E</span>: &ldquo;w<span class="hi">e</span>ll&rdquo;</li>
<li><span class="s">I</span>: &ldquo;mach<span class="hi">i</span>ne&rdquo;</li>
<li><span class="s">O</span>: &ldquo;f<span class="hi">o</span>r&rdquo;</li>
<li><span class="s">U</span>: &ldquo;br<span class="hi">u</span>te&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>With those examples in mind, try pronouncing these words:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">ungol</span> <q>spider</q></li>
<li><span class="s">lembas</span> <q>waybread</q></li>
<li><span class="s">Legolas</span> <q>Greenleaf</q></li>
<li><span class="s">Osgiliath</span> <q>Citadel of the Stars</q></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Sixth Vowel: Y</h3>

<p>In addition to the five main vowels, Sindarin has a sixth vowel <span class="s">Y</span> with no equivalent in English. It&#39;s the sound of <em>u</em> in French <em>lune</em>, or <em>ü</em> in German <em>über</em>. To pronounce it, say <q>ee</q> but with your lips rounded as if saying <q>oo</q>.</p>

<p>If those instructions sound nonsensical, it&#39;s because <q>ee</q> usually stretches your lips into a smile, basically the opposite of <q>oo</q>. (That&#39;s why people say <q>cheese</q> for photos!) However, the other important feature of <q>ee</q> is that your mouth is nearly closed when saying it, leaving only a small air gap above your tongue. So combine that <q>closeness</q> with lip-rounding and you have the Sindarin <span class="s">Y</span> sound.</p>

<h3>Accents and Vowel Length</h3>

<p>An acute accent (<span class="s">á é í ó ú</span>) indicates that the vowel is held for a slightly longer duration. So in a word like <span class="s">míriel</span> <q>sparkling like jewels</q>, the first syllable <span class="s">mí</span> is held about twice as long as the second syllable <span class="s">ri</span>.</p>

<p>A circumflex (<span class="s">â ê î ô û</span>) also indicates a long vowel, but is mostly used in words of one syllable. This may just be an aesthetic whim of Tolkien&#39;s, though he justified it by saying that vowels with the circumflex should be held <em>even longer</em>. However, the Elvish writing systems only distinguish two vowel lengths, long and short, so the Elves must not have considered this detail very important.</p>

<h3>Diphthongs</h3>

<p>A diphthong (pronounced <span class="pron">DIFF-thong</span>, from the Greek for <q>two sounds</q>) is a combination of two vowel sounds that blur together into a single syllable. Diphthongs appear frequently in English, like the <q>ou</q> in <q>house</q> that starts with an <q>ah</q> sound and ends with an <q>oo</q> sound. Sindarin has a similar diphthong, spelled <span class="s">au</span>.</p>

<p>Here is the complete list of Sindarin diphthongs:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">AI</span>: as in &ldquo;<span class="hi">ai</span>sle&rdquo;</li>
<li><span class="s">AE</span>: no English equivalent. <span class="s">AE</span> is a glide from an <span class="s">A</span> into an <span class="s">E</span>. The resulting sound should be similar to <span class="s">AI</span>; Tolkien even suggested pronouncing <span class="s">AE</span> the same as <span class="s">AI</span> if you&#39;re not picky. Or you could aim for a Mirkwood accent and pronounce it like <span class="s">E</span>: compare Mirkwood <span class="s">Legolas</span> to Classical Sindarin <span class="s">Laegolas</span>.</li>
<li><span class="s">AU</span> or <span class="s">AW</span>: like <q>ou</q> in &ldquo;h<span class="hi">ou</span>se&rdquo;. <span class="s">AU</span> and <span class="s">AW</span> are simply variant spellings of the same sound.</li>
<li><span class="s">EI</span>: as in &ldquo;w<span class="hi">ei</span>gh&rdquo;</li>
<li><span class="s">OE</span>: like <q>oy</q> in &ldquo;b<span class="hi">oy</span>&rdquo;, but ending in an <q>eh</q> sound.</li>
<li><span class="s">UI</span>: as in <q>ruin</q>, but ending in a tense <q>ee</q> sound rather than the <q>ih</q> sound. Tolkien noted that this was a <q>long diphthong</q> and scanned as two syllables in poetry: hence <span class="s">Fanuilos, le linnathon</span> in the Hymn to Elbereth, where the meter requires eight syllables per line.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Consonants</h2>

<h3>Voiced and Voiceless Sounds</h3>

<p>Sindarin has several pairs of consonant sounds that differ by being <em>voiced</em> or <em>voiceless</em>—<em>voice</em> being a linguistics term meaning vibration of the vocal cords. Don&#39;t be worried by the terminology, though. If you can speak English, you&#39;re already pronouncing voiced and voiceless sounds all the time. You can feel the buzzing of your vocal cords if you put your hand on your throat and say <q>ZZZ</q>. If you then turn the Z into an S, the buzzing stops. Voiced sounds like Z or V have a buzzing or humming quality, while their voiceless counterparts S and F sound more like a hiss or whisper. (In fact, voicelessness is <em>the</em> defining feature of whispering. Try whispering <em>loudly</em>; your speech may be audible but you&#39;ll be pronouncing all the sounds voicelessly.</p>

<p>Voiced/voiceless pairs in English include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Voiced V, voiceless F: <em>veil</em> vs. <em>fail</em></li>
<li>Voiced Z, voiceless S: <em>zoo</em> vs. <em>sue</em></li>
<li>Voiced J, voiceless CH: <em>gin</em> vs. <em>chin</em></li>
<li>Voiced D, voiceless T: <em>deal</em> vs. <em>teal</em></li>
<li>Voiced G, voiceless K: <em>got</em> vs. <em>caught</em></li>
<li>Voiced B, voiceless P: <em>bun</em> vs. <em>pun</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Sindarin has many of the same pairs as English, but some won&#39;t be familiar:</p>

<ul>
<li>Voiced <span class="s">R</span>, voiceless <span class="s">RH</span></li>
<li>Voiced <span class="s">L</span>, voiceless <span class="s">LH</span></li>
<li>Voiced <span class="s">W</span>, voiceless <span class="s">HW</span></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ll describe all of these in the giant list of consonants below.</p>

<h3>The Consonants of Sindarin</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="s">B</span>: as in English.</li>
<li><span class="s">C</span>: always hard, as in <q>cat</q>. <span class="s">Celeborn</span> is pronounced <em>Keleborn</em>, not <em>Seleborn</em>.</li>
<li><span class="s">CH</span>: as in Scottish <em>loch</em> or German <em>Bach</em>. If you have a hard time replicating this sound, you could pronounce it like H or K, as the Gondorians did. In the Gondor dialect the place-name <em>Rochann</em> was pronounnced as if the <em>ch</em> were an <em>h</em>—hence the spelling <em>Rohan</em> in <em>LotR</em>.</li>
<li><span class="s">D</span>: as in English, except in the combination <span class="s">DH</span>, below.</li>
<li><span class="s">DH</span>: like the <em>th</em> in <em>weather</em>. This is a voiced sound; contrast with voiceless <span class="s">TH</span>. If you have trouble keeping the <span class="s">DH</span>/<span class="s">TH</span> distinction straight, remember that <span class="s">DH</span> is like Z pronounced with an exaggerated lisp.</li>
<li><span class="s">F</span>: usually pronounced as in English, but at the end of a word it sounds like <span class="s">V</span> (think English <q>of</q>). The word <span class="s">nef</span> <q>on this side of</q> is pronounced <em>nev</em> as in English <q>never</q>. This quirk of spelling probably hearkens back to Tolkien&#39;s fondness for Welsh, where <em>f</em> has a V-sound.</li>
<li><span class="s">H</span>: as in English—though it often combines with other letters: see <span class="s">CH</span>, <span class="s">DH</span>, <span class="s">HW</span>, <span class="s">LH</span>, <span class="s">RH</span>, <span class="s">TH</span>.</li>
<li><span class="s">HW</span>: the <em>wh</em> sound of <q>whale</q>, in varieties of English that pronounce it differently from <q>wail</q>. This is a voiceless version of <span class="s">W</span>.</li>
<li><span class="s">I</span>: is normally a vowel but moonlights as a consonant. When it appears before another vowel at the beginning of a word, it sounds like the Y in <q>yes</q>. So <span class="s">ionnath</span> <q>sons</q> and <span class="s">Ioreth</span> <q>Old Woman</q> begin with a <q>yo</q> sound.</li>
<li><span class="s">M</span>: as in English.</li>
<li><span class="s">P</span>: as in English.</li>
<li><span class="s">PH</span>: as in <em>photograph</em>. In the middle of a word, it represents a lengthened F-sound: a word like <em>ephel</em> <q>outer fence</q> would be pronounced <em>ef-fel</em>.</li>
<li><span class="s">N</span>: as in English.</li>
<li><span class="s">NG</span> at the end of a word is the sound heard in <q>sing</q>. Elsewhere it represents the same sound plus a hard G, as in <q>finger</q>.</li>
<li><span class="s">G</span>: is always hard, as in <q>get</q>. Sindarin doesn&#39;t have the J-sound heard in <q>gem</q>.</li>
<li><span class="s">L</span>: always as in <q>let</q>, with the tip of the tongue touching or just behind the upper teeth. In English, L is sometimes pronounced with the tongue bunched up in the back of the mouth, as in <q>cold</q>, but this variant of L does not exist in Sindarin.</li>
<li><span class="s">LH</span>: the sound of <em>LL</em> in Welsh <em>Llewellyn</em>—a peculiar sound, if you&#39;ve not heard it before. To pronounce it, put your tongue in a position to say L, and blow gently. The resulting sound should be somewhere between <em>th</em> and <em>sl</em> (in fact, the LH sound developed from earlier SL, found in Old Sindarin).</li>
<li><span class="s">R</span>: trilled, as in Spanish. In Appendix E, Tolkien notes that the back-of-the-throat R-sound heard in French or German was not used by the Elves.</li>
<li><span class="s">RH</span>: a Sindarin R-sound pronounced voicelessly. If you can pronounce R and HW, you&#39;re halfway to pronouncing RH. Just pronounce R while exhaling breathily as for HW.</li>
<li><span class="s">S</span>: never sounds like Z, as it often does in English at the end of a word. It is always pronounced as in <q>sets</q>.</li>
<li><span class="s">T</span>: as in English.</li>
<li><span class="s">TH</span>: the sound of <em>th</em> in <em>thin</em>. This is a voiceless sound, contrasting with voiced <span class="s">DH</span>.</li>
<li><span class="s">V</span>: as in English.</li>
<li><span class="s">W</span>: as in English. <span class="s">W</span> can occur at the end of a word in Sindarin, where it is pronounced as a very short <span class="s">U</span> sound: <span class="s">têw</span> <q>letter</q>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Splitting Up Letter Combinations</h3>

<p>The combinations <span class="s">DH</span>, <span class="s">LH</span>, <span class="s">RH</span>, <span class="s">TH</span> sometimes represent a sequence of two distinct sounds, e.g. T+H. For example, <span class="s">Panthael</span> (<q>Fullwise</q>, a name given to Sam Gamgee by Aragorn), is a compound <span class="s">pant+hael</span>, so the <span class="s">t</span> and <span class="s">h</span> represent distinct sounds. Similarly, <span class="s">Edhelharn</span> <q>Elfstone</q>, is a compound <span class="s">edhel+harn</span>.</p>

<p>How do you know when to pronounce the letter-sequence <q>th</q> as T+H, and when to pronounce it as a single sound? The answer, unfortunately, is that you just have to recognize the rare cases where <q>th</q> represents T+H.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting that the sounds <span class="s">LH</span> and <span class="s">RH</span> cannot occur in the middle of a word, so if you see a word like <span class="s">Edhelharn</span> or <span class="s">Perhael</span> <q>Halfwise</q>, you know that the <span class="s">H</span> should be a separate sound.</p>

<p>Tengwar writing doesn&#39;t have this ambiguity, because the sounds <span class="s">DH</span>, <span class="s">LH</span>, <span class="s">RH</span>, <span class="s">TH</span> each have their own symbol. So recognizing letter combinations that should be split up isn&#39;t just relevant for pronunciation—you need to know this to write in tengwar, as well!</p>

<h2>Stress</h2>

<p>Sindarin, like English, puts emphasis or <em>stress</em> on one syllable of multi-syllable words. In English, stress can alter the meaning of a word, as in the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sam received a <strong>present</strong> from Galadriel.
Galadriel will <strong>present</strong> the hobbits with lembas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the first syllable stressed, &ldquo;<span class="hi">pre</span>sent&rdquo; is a noun. Stress the second syllable, &ldquo;pre<span class="hi">sent</span>&rdquo;, and it becomes a verb.</p>

<p>In Sindarin, the stress of a word can&#39;t change its meaning, but it&#39;s vital to learn how words are stressed in order to write poetry. If you don&#39;t pronounce words with the right stress, you&#39;ll just sound weird.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Sindarin stress is predicatable from the shape of the word, so you don&#39;t have to memorize where the stress falls for each word individually. This section describes how to figure out which syllable is stressed.</p>

<h3>Syllables</h3>

<p>Before you can place the stress in a word, you have to break it down into syllables. The syllables or beats of a word are determined by the vowels. Each syllable has exactly one vowel or diphthong at its core—no more, no less. So <span class="s">Elbereth Gilthoniel</span> breaks down as <span class="s">El&middot;be&middot;reth Gil&middot;tho&middot;ni&middot;el</span>. <span class="s">Thranduil</span> has only two syllables, <span class="s">Thran&middot;duil</span>, because <span class="s">ui</span> is a diphthong.</p>

<h3>Stress in Two-Syllable Words</h3>

<p>Tolkien states in Appendix E that <q>[i]n words of two syllables, [the stress] falls in practically all cases on the first syllable</q>. However, he neglects to list any Sindarin exceptions to this rule, so for our purposes, two-syllable Sindarin words are <em>always</em> stressed on the first syllable. Thus we have <span class="s"><span class="hi">Per</span>&middot;hael</span> <q>Samwise</q>, <span class="s"><span class="hi">El</span>&middot;rond</span>.</p>

<h3>Stress in Longer Words</h3>

<p>The general rule for longer words is to stress the third-to-last syllable: <span class="s"><span class="hi">El</span>&middot;be&middot;reth</span>, <span class="s">Gil&middot;<span class="hi">tho</span>&middot;ni&middot;el</span>, <span class="s"><span class="hi">Le</span>&middot;go&middot;las</span></p>

<p>However, the second-to-last syllable gets the stress if its vowel is:</p>

<ul>
<li>long (accented), as <span class="s">í</span> in <span class="s">Celeb<span class="hi">rí</span>an</span> (<q>Silver-queen</q>, Arwen&#39;s mother)</li>
<li>a diphthong, as <span class="s">ae</span> in <span class="s">Hi<span class="hi">thaeg</span>lir</span> (<q>the Misty Mountains</q>)</li>
<li>or followed by multiple consonants: <span class="s">Cele<span class="hi">brim</span>bor</span> (<q>Silver-fist</q>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in the last case, it&#39;s consonant <em>sounds</em> and not letters that are important. <span class="s">TH</span>, <span class="s">DH</span>, etc. are single sounds even though they&#39;re represented by two letters, so the <span class="s">th</span> in <span class="s"><span class="hi">Nim</span>brethil</span> doesn&#39;t cause the stress to move.</p>

<h3>Possible Exceptions to the Stress Rule</h3>

<p>There are some Sindarin names that don&#39;t seem to follow the stress rules in Appendix E, among them <span class="s">Imladris</span> (Rivendell) and <span class="s">Nargothrond</span>. These <q>should</q> be stressed <span class="s">Im<span class="hi">lad</span>ris</span>, <span class="s">Nar<span class="hi">goth</span>rond</span>, because the second-to-last syllable of each is followed by two consonants. However, we can observe that both are stressed on the first syllable in poetry. I&#39;ve written at length about this issue <a href="../stress-in-sindarin.html">here</a>.</p>
