<h1>The Sounds of Elvish</h1>

<p>Before you start to put Sindarin words together into sentences, it&rsquo;s a good idea to learn how the words themselves are supposed to be pronounced. One of Tolkien&rsquo;s goals in designing his languages was to create words that he personally found beautiful, and he wrote a great deal about his love for the euphony of certain languages (notably Welsh and Finnish). With this in mind, it should be clear that correct pronunciation of Tolkien&rsquo;s languages is essential to appreciate them fully.</p>

<p>Following is a list of resources for studying Sindarin pronunciation.</p>

<h2>Primary Sources</h2>

<ul>
<li>Appendix E of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> – <span class="toc-detail">covers many aspects of the languages, including pronunciation.</span></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jrrvf.com/%7Eglaemscrafu/english/tolkienhimself.html">Recordings of Tolkien (on the Glǽmscrafu site)</a> – <span class="toc-detail">In 1952, Tolkien read excerpts from the then-unpublished <em>Lord of the Rings</em> into a tape recorder, giving us a unique view into how he pronounced his own words. Highly recommended listening!</span></li>
</ul>

<li>Sindarin teacher <strong>dreamingfifi</strong> has a <a href="http://your-sindarin-textbook.realelvish.net/chapter1/lesson3/">very thorough set of lessons</a> on Sindarin pronunciation. She uses IPA alongside less technical methods to teach the sounds.</li>
<li>Quenya revivalist Helge Fauskanger has an <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/sindarin.htm#Heading6">article on Sindarin</a> that briefly covers pronunciation. (Note that the article, while superbly researched at the time it was written, has not been updated recently. Some of its material may be out of date. The pronunciation section is still as relevant as ever, though.)</li>
