<h1>Beginnings</h1>

<p>...</p>

<p>The study of fictional languages is definitely not a hobby for everyone. Maybe the sound of <span class="q">elen síla lúmenn&rsquo; omentielvo</span> doesn&rsquo;t move you at all, or the letters just look like an indecipherable jumble on the page. Maybe you studied Latin in school and hated it. But if you feel at all inclined to learn more, this is the book for you.</p>

<hr>

<p>The supposed <q>fundamentals</q> in these courses are constantly shifting under our feet as new material is published by the Tolkien Estate. Thorsten Renk&rsquo;s course <em>Pedin Edhellen</em> has been revised several times over the last decade as new information has come out. This is not a criticism of Renk or his work. Rather, he should be commended for his long-term commitment to keeping his courses up-to-date. However, it must frustrate his readers when the dialogue in the very first chapter of the course is revised, and with it the grammar rules it is supposed to demonstrate. This shows that the concepts he presents as foundational to the grammar are not really foundational to Tolkien&rsquo;s use of the language. In many cases they are far from certain. Someone who reads only the first few chapters of Renk&rsquo;s course will not learn much about Tolkien&rsquo;s Sindarin, only about Renk&rsquo;s interpretation of the currently available data—which, while interesting and valuable, is probably not what most of his readers believe they are getting.</p>

<p>My goal with this book is to present an Elvish language in a way that acknowledges the peculiar difficulties of Tolkien&rsquo;s languages and works through them in an accessible and balanced way. By <q>difficulties</q> I don&rsquo;t mean hard-to-pronounce words or complex grammar. The main difficulty is that Tolkien&rsquo;s languages aren&rsquo;t fixed, static entities; Tolkien was constantly revising them, in broad strokes and in detail, throughout his life, and they never stabilized. Furthermore, there are some details that Tolkien never worked out: these leave gaps in the language that can only be filled by guesswork.</p>

<p>The inconsistencies and missing pieces of the language can certainly be patched up, but anyone who presents such a <q>restored</q> version of the language as Tolkien canon is at best oversimplifying the facts, and at worst misrepresenting them. The main difficulty in writing about Elvish is that presenting and analyzing all the data would produce a treatise of mind-boggling complexity, while simplifying the language to a primer for students misrepresents Tolkien&rsquo;s work and usurps his place as the sole creator of his world.</p>

<p>My main criticism of the other available resources is that they don&rsquo;t take the peculiar difficulties of the Elvish languages into account. They are usually written either in the style of a foreign language course, or as a historical grammar of a dead language. The problem is that Tolkien&rsquo;s languages aren&rsquo;t fixed, static entities that can be cleanly described in a course or a grammar. Tolkien was constantly revising his languages to suit his own aesthetic whims, and many of the details of Elvish were simply never worked out.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that the gaps can&rsquo;t be plausibly filled. The wonderful thing about languages is that they follow regular patterns, so we can use patterns in one part of the language to make guesses about how another part should work. It&rsquo;s a bit like reconstructing a damaged painting or a fresco—we can&rsquo;t hope to get all the details exactly as the original artist did, but at least we can get close.</p>

<p>The problem is that Tolkien&rsquo;s languages are emphatically <em>not like</em> the languages of our own earth—not because their words or grammar are particularly strange, but because they serve a different purpose. On Earth, we use languages to communicate with each other, and also to define social groups. Tolkien designed his languages to be <em>beautiful</em>, not useful</p>

<p>He probably had further remarks on the subject of philology, but none made it into the column, so the one sentence that remained probably did more to confuse than to enlighten those who read it. To avert further confusion, Tolkien wrote to his publishers with some remarks they could send to anyone else with inquiries about his work</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
<cite>J.R.R. Tolkien, <em>The Hobbit</em></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So begins (for many of us) our first glimpse of J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s Middle-earth. But <em>The Hobbit</em> is not where Middle-earth began for Tolkien. His fantasy world had much deeper roots. Before writing <em>The Hobbit</em> he penned stories of elves and angelic Valar, of calamitous battles and the rise and fall of kingdoms. And those stories had roots as well: in the legend of Atlantis, the Old English epic of Beowulf, and the Finnish <em>Kalevala</em>. But if we delve even deeper, we find that the real kernel of Tolkien&rsquo;s genius was not his stories. It was his <em>languages</em>.</p>

<p>J.R.R. Tolkien created languages—fantastical, intricate, beautiful languages. And since languages need people to speak them, he invented those too, and started writing stories about them. From early on he framed his languages as being spoken by creatures of myth: first <q>Gnomes</q> and later the Elves of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.</p>

<p>Tolkien wasn&rsquo;t the first person to singlehandedly create a language. In the decade before Tolkien&rsquo;s birth, grammars of two artificial languages were published: L. L. Zamenhof&rsquo;s <em>Unua Libro</em> for his language <em>Esperanto</em>, and Johann Martin Schleyer&rsquo;s book on <em>Volapük</em>. Both languages were intended to be mediums of international communication—simple, familiar-seeming, and easy to learn. Tolkien&rsquo;s goal was different. His goal for the Elvish languages was not to make them easy to speak, or indeed speakable at all. He wanted his languages to be beautiful. He wanted to create art.</p>

<p>There was a problem, or at the very least a complication: Tolkien&rsquo;s idea of what was <q>beautiful</q> in a language changed throughout his life, constantly. As a result he never got his languages into a <q>finished</q> state where he could write a whole grammar and dictionary for them. To do so was never his aim. As a result, there are gaps, often large gaps, in our knowledge of Tolkien&rsquo;s languages, and our uncertainty is compounded by the many different incompatible versions of each language that Tolkien created, sequentially, over the course of nearly 60 years.</p>

<p>Now, Tolkien himself never published descriptions of his languages, and the few snippets of Elvish poetry and prose in his writings hardly cover all the details of grammar. So where do these courses get their information?</p>

<p>We can get a long way toward a speakable language by making some <em>educated guesses</em>. By analyzing the patterns in the language samples we <em>do</em> have, we can fill the gaps in the grammar, smooth over the inconsistencies, and add new vocabulary. David Salo, who wrote the Elvish dialogue and lyrics for the Peter Jackson movies, is perhaps the foremost expert on this process. His book, <em>A Gateway to Sindarin</em>, takes a step toward a <q>finished</q> Elvish language by describing Sindarin almost as if it were a real language of our own Earth. We&rsquo;d like to imagine that the result is close to what Tolkien himself might have published if he&rsquo;d collected all his writings into a Sindarin grammar.</p>

<p>He worked on them whenever his harrowing schedule would allow it, using whatever materials were at hand—the back of an envelope, a postcard, a stack of waste paper from his publisher.</p>

<p>In a letter to his wife Edith, 24-year-old Tolkien wrote <q>I have done some touches to my nonsense fairy-language [. . .] I often long to work at it and don't let myself 'cause though I love it so it does seem such a mad hobby!</q> <span class="citation">Letters #4</span> Mad or not, the hobby grew to astonishing dimensions and bore fabulous fruit, though Tolkien never quite got over his shyness when it came to sharing his languages with the world.</p>

<ul>
<li>quote to the effect that languages gave more delight to readers than anything else in the story</li>
<li>readers would have liked more languages</li>
<li>Tolkien was adamant that his languages and names not be adapted for translations</li>
</ul>

<p>The two major writing systems used for Sindarin were the <em>tengwar</em> (a Quenya term; the Sindar called the letters <span class="s">tîw</span>), and the <span class="s">cirth</span> (pronounced <q>keerth</q>). The <em>tengwar</em> were a flowing script suitable for writing with a brush or pen, while the runic <span class="s">cirth</span> were angular, designed for scratching or carving into stone or wood.</p>

<p>The <em>cirth</em> were invented by Sindarin-speakers <span class="TODO">confirm?</span> in Middle-earth, so in a sense they are the most natively Sindarin writing system. However, they did not reach their most mature form, the <em>Angerthas Daeron</em>, until after the exiled Noldor returned to Middle-earth, bringing the <em>tengwar</em> with them. The <em>Angerthas</em> or <q>long rune-rows</q> were inspired by the design of the <em>tengwar</em>, and like the <em>tengwar</em> could be applied to many different languages.</p>

<p>The forms of the <em>cirth</em> were adopted by the Dwarves for their own language Khuzdul. The inscription on Balin&rsquo;s tomb was written in <em>cirth</em>.</p>

<p>Fëanor&rsquo;s writing system wasn&rsquo;t the first in Arda—an earlier system, the <em>sarati</em>, were invented by Rumil. But Fëanor made an important innovation with the <em>tengwar</em>: he realized that the shape of each letter could be related to its sound in a systematic way. For contrast, look at the English alphabet: <em>M</em> and <em>B</em> both involve closing the lips, but there&rsquo;s nothing in their shapes that expresses this similarity. On the other hand, lowercase <em>b</em> and <em>p</em> do look sort of similar and are pronounced similarly—<em>p</em> is just <em>b</em> with more forceful airflow (in linguistic terms, <em>p</em> is <em>aspirated</em>). But the pattern doesn&rsquo;t generalize: we&rsquo;d expect an aspirated version of <em>d</em> to have the letter-form <em>q</em>, but in fact aspirated <em>d</em> is written <em>t</em>.</p>

<h2>The Cirth</h2>

<p>The runic <span class="s">cirth</span> are less iconic than the <em>tengwar</em>, but they&rsquo;re easier to write.</p>
