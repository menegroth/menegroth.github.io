<h1>Writing Sindarin in the Elvish Scripts</h1>

<h2>Overview of the Writing Systems</h2>

<p>The two major writing systems used for Sindarin were the <span class="s">tîw</span> (better known by their Quenya name <em>tengwar</em>), and the <span class="s">cirth</span> (pronounced <q>keerth</q>). The <em>tengwar</em> were a flowing script suitable for writing with a brush or pen, while the runic <span class="s">cirth</span> were angular, designed for scratching or carving into stone or wood.</p>

<h3>Tengwar</h3>

<p>The <em>tengwar</em> were invented by Fëanor in Aman, and so were first used to write Quenya. But Fëanor, always ambitious, didn&rsquo;t just devise an alphabet solely for his own language. He created a system so versatile that it could be adapted to <em>any</em> language. Thus when the exiled Noldor brought the <em>tengwar</em> to Middle-earth, the Sindar readily adopted the script. By the Third Age there were multiple styles or <q>modes</q> for writing Sindarin with <em>tengwar</em>, each with its own spelling conventions.</p>

<p>Even Sauron recognized the beauty of <em>tengwar</em> and used them to write the inscription (in the Black Speech) on the One Ring:</p>

<div class="center text">

<span class="tai">&#187;</span><span class="ti">AE5,Ex26Yw1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; AE5,ExxwP%1Ej^</span><span class="tai">&#171;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="ti">AE5,Ex37zE1E<span class="tai">j</span>^z<span class="tai">H</span>&#186; X#w6Ykt^AT`Bz7qpT1Ej^</span>
</p>
</div>

<h3>Cirth</h3>

<p>The <em>cirth</em>, in contrast to the <em>tengwar</em>, were invented in Middle-earth, so in a sense they are the most natively Sindarin writing system. However, they did not reach their most mature form, the <em>Angerthas Daeron</em>, until after the exiled Noldor returned to Middle-earth. The <em>Angerthas</em> or <q>long rune-rows</q> were inspired by the organization of the <em>tengwar</em>, and like the <em>tengwar</em> could be applied to many different languages.</p>

<h2>Resources for Learning the Writing Systems</h2>

<ul>
<li>Appendix E to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> – The authoritative source for much of our information about the <em>tengwar</em> and <em>cirth</em>. Unfortunately for beginners, it makes heavy use of linguistic terms, so it&rsquo;s not the most accessible resource. It presents guidelines for writing Sindarin, Quenya, English, and the Black Speech, but Tolkien, presumably to save space, doesn&rsquo;t give each language its own section—he presents them all together in a jumble. You basically have to comprehend the whole thing before you can write in any of the languages it discusses.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/teng-sin.pdf"><em>Tîw i Lam Thindrim</em>, by Per Lindberg</a> – available as a PDF download. It&rsquo;s a good summary of the major Sindarin tengwar modes. Oddly, the tables showing the pronunciation of each <em>tengwa</em> are at the end of the document. I&rsquo;d advise printing out the last two pages and keeping them handy while you read the rest of it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/a-gateway-to-sindarin-david-salo/1111582229"><em>A Gateway to Sindarin</em>, by David Salo</a> – Salo&rsquo;s book describes how to use the <em>tengwar</em> and <em>cirth</em> to write Sindarin, and is the best secondary source that I know of for learning the <em>cirth</em>. However, it assumes some linguistic knowledge (such as a general familiarity with phonetic alphabets) as well as a basic understanding of the historical development of Sindarin. It&rsquo;s also pretty pricey, and has received some <a href="http://www.science-and-fiction.org/elvish/salo_discussion.html">critical feedback</a> for its approach to the language. While the chapter on writing is good, I would not recommend buying it for that chapter alone.</li>
