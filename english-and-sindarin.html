<h1>English, Sindarin, and <q>Alien Tongues</q></h1>

<blockquote>
<p>14 January 1956
Merton College, Oxford
Dear Mr Thompson,
  Thank you very much for your kind and encouraging letter. Having set myself a task, the arrogance of which I fully recognized and trembled at: being precisely to restore to the English an epic tradition and present them with a mythology of their own: it is a wonderful thing to be told that I have succeeded, at least with those who have still the undarkened heart and mind.
<cite>(<em>Letters</em> #180)</cite></p>

<p>The use of the circumflex in other [non-Sindarin] languages such as Adûnaic or Dwarvish has no special significance, and is used merely to mark these out as alien tongues (as with the use of <em>k</em>). <cite>(<em>The Return of the King</em>, Appendix E)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps Khuzdul and Adûnaic are <q>alien</q> to Middle-earth in the primary-world sense that Tolkien placed these languages in his stories after the world was first conceived. They were not the languages that sparked its genesis.</p>
